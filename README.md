## What is NILM?

- Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technique used to monitor the power consumption of individual devices within smart homes by disaggregating aggregated power data collected from a central power bus. This technology eliminates the need to install individual meters for each appliance, making it scalable and easy to apply in large settings. By providing detailed insights into energy usage, NILM can help reduce power wastage and prevent potential fire hazards, contributing to more efficient and safer smart home environments.

### What we make?:

We have developed a demo toolkit to share our experimental results and provide streamlined models for the benefit of future researchers. This toolkit consists of two main sections:  
1. **Power Compression and Reconstruction:** A method for compressing and reconstructing high-resolution load power data.  
2. **Load-Level Power Disaggregation:** Two methods for accurately estimating the individual power consumption of devices.

For more detailed technical information, please refer to our papers [1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10225311) and [2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10673806).

The methods presented in this toolkit utilize common datasets, such as UK-DALE and REDD. Additionally, we can provide our own dataset, which includes load data selected from these two sources.
